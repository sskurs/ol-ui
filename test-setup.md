## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port 3000 in use**: Change port in `nuxt.config.ts`
2. **API connection errors**: Ensure backend is running on port 8181
3. **Build errors**: Check Node.js version (requires 18+)

### Development Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Generate static site
npm run generate
```

## Docker Alternative
If you prefer using Docker:
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f ../docker-compose.nuxt.yml up -d

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

## API Integration Notes
The frontend is configured to connect to the OpenLoyalty backend API at `http://localhost:8181`. 
Replace mock data with real API calls in the store and page components.
